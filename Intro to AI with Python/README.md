CS50's Intro to Artifical Intelligence w/Python is a course I will be taking in order to gain a understanding
of the modern use of AI and the ideas that lie within the topic. 
It will expose the theory of search algos, classification, optimisation and ML/LLMs 
I hopefully will be able to use this knowledge to utilise within my own studies/ventures
